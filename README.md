Todo-o-matic
============

Like Gina Trapani, I found myself returning to a simple "todo.txt"
after each excurtion into a heavier-weight, more complicated task or
project tracker (and my original todo.txt is probably older than she
is :).

My todo.txt format has gotten a little more complicated over the
years, but only a little.  It now includes a date/time stamp at the
top of each "chunk," which is a shortish list of tasks for one day or
so.  I could have added a timestamp at the beginning or end of every
line, but that results in more, cluttered output.

These programs help by:

1) merging multiple todo.txt files into one file, in the case that
I've copied my todo.txt to another computer, worked there, then
returned to the original and worked there too, and

2) sweeping completed tasks into a "done.txt" and forwarding older
unfinished tasks to today.
